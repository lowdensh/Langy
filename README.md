Langy is a reading-focused foreign language learning aid orientated towards young children.

Reading is an activity that every child knows. It is a necessary skill that is learned at school and at home, not only building on a child’s linguistic capability but also their cognitive and social skills.

Langy aims to enable children to learn a new language in a manner that feels familiar to them. The platform allows users to read a variety of children’s books. Some words in the text are translated into the user's learning language - a foreign language of choice - which are indicated and can be selected to show the English translation.
